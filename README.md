# Image Gallery Web App - RIA Version

The project consists of a web app that manages an image gallery.
Every user can register, login, create a new album, upload an image on an album, write a comment below an image, see other's user images.
The RIA version adds (in addition to client-side controls and modal pages) the possibility to reorder personal images.

The project was part of the final evaluation of the course Technology for Web Applications.

## üêû Bugs
During the final evaluation has been discovered a bug in the PostImage servlet that denies the possibility to use the web app in parallel on more than one different sessions open (while posting a new image).
This problem has been reported but not fixed.
The table sorting's servlet doesn't implement the auto-commit, which should complete the app in a better way.
